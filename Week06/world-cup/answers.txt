Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, the United States is always the leading team, but proved to be incorrect after running with a huge number of simulations, which is Germany

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

The predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
